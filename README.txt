This project uses the Stylized Fantasy Village package from the Unity asset store:
https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/fantasy/stylized-fantasy-village-85707

This package must be placed in a Packages folder, like this:
Assets\Packages\LowlyPoly\Stylized Village Fantasy\...

It only is for visuals, therefore they can be replaced by any other visual without affecting games functionalities.
