This project uses the Stylized Fantasy Village package from the Unity asset store
Download here: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/fantasy/stylized-fantasy-village-85707

This package must be placed in a Packages folder, like this:
Assets\Packages\LowlyPoly\Stylized Village Fantasy\...
The materials will also need to be converted to URP

It only is for visuals, therefore they can be replaced by any other visuals without affecting the games functionalities.
