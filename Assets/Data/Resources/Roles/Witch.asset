    knows for sure, but the power of her potion is undeniable.

    has two potion she can used: a life potion and a death potion. Each night, she
    will be told who was killed by the werewolves. she can then use her potions.
    Each potion can be only used once during the game, but she can use both potion

    which could be herself. The death potion will kill a player that she selects.
