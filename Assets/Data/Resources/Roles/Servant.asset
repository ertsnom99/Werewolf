  <Description>k__BackingField: 'Who could ask for a better servant then one who
    would give their life for their master? Do be careful, because her ambition could
    bring the village to its end!

    

    Just before the reveal of the role
    of a player killed by the village vote, she can reveal herself. Afterward, she
    will lose her role and take the one of the dead player, without revealing what
    it is. From that point on, she will play as that new role.
