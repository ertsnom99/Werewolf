    m_Localized: "Day and Night Cycle\r\n\r\nThe game works with a day and night
      cycle. During the night, some villagers will be able to use their role power.
      The werewolves will also be called to select a victim. Once all necessary villagers
      have been called, it will become day. At the start of the day, any dead villagers,
      and their roles, will be revealed. The village will than debate about who should
      be executed, then vote. After the voted villager was executed, it will become
      night. If there is no captain and an equality happens, a second vote will start,
      but only the villagers that had the highest number of votes can be voted for.
      If an equality happens again, no villager will be executed, and the day will
      end. Not voting for any villager during this vote will result in voting for
      yourself.\r\n\r\nRoles\r\n\r\nEach villager will be given a role. Each of them
      has a group of villagers which they belong to. The two principal groups are
      the villagers and the werewolves. There are also special roles, called lonely,
      that wants to win alone by fulfilling some special condition. There are also
      ambiguous roles that can change which group they belong to during the game.
      Read the description of each role for more details.\r\n\r\nCaptain\r\n\r\nThe
      captain is a title that can be given to a villager. The captain's execution
      vote will count for two. In the case of an equality, the captain chooses who
      will be executed. When the captain dies, he will choose which villager will
      be the next captain. \r\n\r\nElecting a Captain\r\n\r\nAt the start of the
      first day, an election will take place. It will start with all villagers being
      asked if they wish to be the captain. If more then one villager wants to be
      the captain, a debate will start to allow those villagers to say why they should
      be the captain. After this debate, all the villagers will vote for who they
      think should be captain. If the vote result into an equality, the captain will
      be randomly selected. If no one wants to be captain, there will be no captain.\r\n\r\nHow
      to Win\r\n\r\nWinners are declared when all the villagers left alive are part
      of the same group. For example, if only werewolves are left, the werewolves
      win. A villager can belong to multiple groups. For example, a werewolf could
      also be in a couple. In this case, he could win if the rest of the villagers
      are werewolves or part of the couple. The winners are only declared after all
      dead villagers are revealed. This means that it is possible that all villagers
      left died during the night, therefore resulting in no one winning.\r"

      card. Villagers can use those to communicate with each other in a more discrete
      way. For example, this can allow werewolves to communicate will they are voting
      without other villagers seeing it. Emotes can be seen by all villagers during
      the day. During the night, only the villagers who are awake (while they are
      using their role\u2019s power, while the couple recognize each other, etc.)
      can see them. There is a limit to how many emotes a villager can send in a
      short period of time. If this limit is reach, a villager emote won\u2019t be
      send until enough time has passed.\r\n\r\nTo send an emote, left click and
      hold on the card of a villager to make the emote well appear. Once the wheel
      is visible, click an emote to attempt to send it. Clicking outside the wheel
      will close it. \r"
