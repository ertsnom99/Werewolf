    m_Localized: "Day and Night Cycle\n\r\nThe game works with a day and night cycle.
      During the night, some players will be asked to use a power associated with
      their role. The werewolves will also be called to select a victim. Once all
      necessary players have been called, it will become day. At the start of the
      day, any dead players, and their roles, will be revealed. The village will
      than debate about who should be executed today, then vote. After the voted
      player was executed, it will become night. Not voting for someone during this
      vote will result in voting for yourself.\r\n\r\nRoles\r\n\r\nEach player will
      be given a role. Each of them has a group of players which they belong to.
      The two principal groups are the villagers and the werewolves. There are also
      special roles call lonely, because they want to win alone, by fulfilling some
      special condition. There are also ambiguous roles that can change which group
      they belong to during the game. Read the description of each role for more
      details.\r\n\r\nCaptain\r\n\r\nThe captain is a title that can be given to
      a player. The captain's vote, for the execution during the day will count for
      two. In the case of an equality, the captain chooses who will be eliminated.
      If there is no captain and an equality happens, a second vote will start, but
      only the players that had the highs number of votes can be voted for. If an
      equality happens again, no one will be executed, and the day will end. When
      the captain dies, he will choose who will be the next captain. \r\n\r\nElecting
      a Captain\r\n\r\nAt the start of the first day, an election will take place.
      This process will start with all players being asked if they wish to be the
      captain. If more then one player wants to be the captain, a debate will start
      to allow those players to say why they should be the captain. After this debate,
      all the players will vote for who they think should be captain. If the vote
      result into an equality, the captain will be randomly selected. If no one wanted
      to be captain, there will be no captain.\r\n\r\nHow to Win\r\n\r\nWinners are
      declared when all the players left alive are part of the same group. For example,
      if only villagers are left, the villagers win. A player can belong to multiple
      groups. For example, a villager could be in a couple, which mean that he would
      belong to both the villager group and the couple group. In this case, if all
      other players are also part of the villager group, the villagers would win.
      The winners are only declared after all dead players are revealed. This means
      that it is possible that all players left died during the night, therefore
      resulting in no one winning.\r\n"
